    "_ **Note**:  the goal of this part of the assignment is to understand the kinds of biases that commonly sneak into machine learned systems and a handful of techniques to improve standard modeling.  While we hope you find this instructive, we empathize that these research results may negatively affect some students.  Please reach out to the teaching staff if you have serious concerns for alternate arrangements._\n",

    "From simple count-based models to the most complex neural architectures, machine learning models are ultimately nothing more than the product of the signals and labels in the training set.  That these tools can so effectively mimic and generalize from the training set distribution is the key to why they are so useful in so many applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This powerful ability to fit a data is a double edged sword.  Unfortunately, the real world is filled with inequality, unfairness and stereotypes.  When the signals and labels systemically capture these aspects of the world, the powerful ability to generalize has other names: bias.  This bias can take many forms:  a minority group of entries in the training set would be underrepresented (the loss function is incented to produce a model that works better on the majority at the expense of the minority) or predictions may be systemically biased against a protected group (i.e. the model learns to predict the protected label and from that the actual prediction rather than learning the prediction directly).\n",

    "In this part of the assignment, we will take a look at a few nice analyses that discuss this bias. Below are a few questions about these papers.\n",

In [Step 5](http://blog.conceptnet.io/posts/2017/how-to-make-a-racist-ai-without-really-trying/#Step-5:-Behold-the-monstrosity-that-we-have-created), the author shows that substituting a type of cuisine into a fixed sentence significantly changes the overall sentiment score of their model.

Neutralize ensures that gender neutral words are zero in the gender subspace. Equalize perfectly equalizes sets of words outside the subspace and thereby enforces the property that any Neutral word is equidistant to all words in each equality set.\n",
